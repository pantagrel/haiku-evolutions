I'm tracking _the pull:_  
What is attention, and how does it shape our lives?  
What are our desire lines — the ones we follow and the ones we bury?  

I'm tracking Eros across the layered terrain of a lived experience. What movement towards aliveness will I find?

Where Scintillus was a calendar, Desire Lines is a compass.  
If Scintillus was the act of recording, Desire Lines is the act of responding.
