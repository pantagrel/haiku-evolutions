I'm tracking _the pull:_  
What is attention, and how does it shape our lives?  
What are our desire lines — the ones we follow and the ones we bury?  

This project is a way to track the signals of Eros across the layered terrain of a lived experience, and with the spellcasting powers of language, find a way to see and say the barely seen and said: the movement towards aliveness.

Where Scintillus was a calendar, Desire Lines is a compass.  
If Scintillus was the act of recording, Desire Lines is the act of responding.
